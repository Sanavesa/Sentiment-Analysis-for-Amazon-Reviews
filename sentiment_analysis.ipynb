I don't know a lot but I know the pizza industry, and American Metalcraft is one of the companies I have LEARNED to rely heavily on. In fairness, my experience is limited to their: Pans, trays, cutting wheels, perforated discs, screens, and soon: This beauty.   \n",

I bought her the ice cream maker attachment for her kitchen aid mixer for her birthday.  She was surprised and VERY HAPPY.  She makes ice cream at least once a week.  It's great!   \n",

       "1  in response to the above review that touches on the quality of steel the workmanship of the handle etc but ultimately says the knife looks like it will perform as advertised and I am guessing did since there is no follow up I would like to say a few things first off this cutter is made from american metalcraft and yes i know the name is a misnomer since their stuff is made in china all of it as far as i know but you should be doing your research prior to purchasing anyways never judge a book by its cover unless you do not care so this should not be surprising secondly american metalcraft is widely regarded as an industry standard company nobody claims that it is the cadillac of the restaurant industry basically they are the honda of the culinary world you do not buy a honda then bring it home go online and point out that your honda is not performing like a mercedes benz this cutter is exactly where it should be it is priced as a mid grade cutter and that is exactly what it is this product is designed to be a work horse and not a showroom piece i just ordered mine today i have seen them in person in the past however so i have not yet received it but I am beyond sure that it will be up to the standard of all the previous am products I have purchased not the mercedes standard but the workhorse reliable standard that i have personally experienced from this company over the last few years so strong is that belief that i was motivated to say something here before mine even shipped it takes a good company and a great product again for the price to gain that kind of loyalty and credit from a discerning customer which i consider myself to be no offense meant to those who have had different experiences these are just my personal thoughts but i think it is very unfair to give others the impression that they are looking at a shoddy product and therefore encouraging them to spend more when the product shown is a very solid piece that will probably outperform some other cutters in a higher price bracket i have worked at three pizza shops and intend to open my own one day i do not know a lot but i know the pizza industry and american metalcraft is one of the companies i have learned to rely heavily on in fairness my experience is limited to their pans trays cutting wheels perforated discs screens and soon this beauty   \n",
